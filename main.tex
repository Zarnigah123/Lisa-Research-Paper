    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
    The gravitational waves (GW) were predicted a year after the final formulation of the general theory of relativity (GR) by Albert Einstein~\cite{Einstein1916}.
    Similar to electromagnetic waves, the GWs travel at the speed of light~\citep{Eddington1922, Abott2017}.
    However, unlike electromagnetic waves, the GW stretches and squeezes the space itself thus causing spatial disturbances.
    The detection of Hulse-Taylor binary~\citep{Hulse1975}, and the subsequent observation of a seven years time
    span~\citep{Taylor1982} stirred a great interest in the GW observations.
    It wasn't until 2015 that the first direct observation of GW was made by LIGO and VIRGO collaborations~\citep{Abott2017}.
    The lower frequency bound for both the aLIGO and VIRGO detectors is around \SI{10}{\hertz}~\cite{aLIGO2015, aVIRGO2014}

    The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has three spacecrafts that form a triangle, each side 2.5 million
    km long~\cite{Prince2002, Robson2019}.
    Operating in the frequency range of \SI{1e-5}{\hertz}$\,\leq  f \leq\,$\SI{1e-1}{\hertz} LISA will be able to observe the sources millions of years before they merge.
    The early detection capability will help better constrain and determine the orbital parameters of the observed binaries.
    Some sources detectable by LISA are the extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs)~\cite{Gair2017, Klein2016, Chapman2022} and galactic binaries~\cite{wagg2021gravitational, Abott2017, Digman2022}.
    This makes LISA also capable of mapping Milky Way galaxy's structure.
    Another interesting class detectable by LISA is the double white dwarf stars (DWDs) which are reported to be abundant in our MW galaxy and have a substantial detection in LISA as well~\cite{Korol2017, Nelemans2001, Willems2007, Ruiter2010}.

    A lot of effort has been put into the detection of potential GW sources for LISA, the resolution of issues that might be associated with the background data, and proposals of new candidates as GW sources for LISA~\cite[see, for example,][]{Lau2020, Sesana2009, Khakhaleva2020, Renzo2021, Fumagalli2022, wagg2021gravitational, Broekgaarden2021, Shao2021, Andrews2020, Belczynski2010, Guo2017, Babak2010, Blaut2010, Babak2008, Ruiter2010, Nelemans2001, Yu2010}.
    The detections of these sources will provide us with a better understanding of not only the evolution phases but also the endpoints of stellar evolution.

    The goals of this research are,
    \begin{itemize}%
        \item to predict the number of DCO binaries that can be detected via LISA in our Milky Way galaxy,
        \item to determine whether extra galactic sources are LISA detectable,
        \item to make a general detection comparison between DCO binaries with and without an initial eccentricity.
    \end{itemize}%

	This research paper is structured as follows, in section~\ref{sec:population_synthesis} we discuss the generation of binary systems using COMPAS suite. In section~\ref{sec:evolution-methodology} we give a general overview of the methodology adopted in this research for evolving the stars from ZAMS to DCOs, from DCOs to merger stage, and their detection by LISA as well. The evolution of binaries and their detection is discussed in section~\ref{sec:evolution-and-detection}.

    \section{Population synthesis}
    \label{sec:population_synthesis}
    The population synthesis for the detections of the double compact objects (DCOs) was performed using the Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics and Statistics (COMPAS; ~\cite{stevenson2017formation, Riley2022, Vigna2018}) suite.
    COMPAS is a rapid stellar evolution suite and can evolve both single and binary stars following the details outlined by~\cite{Hurley2000, Hurley2002}.
    A list of selected papers that make use of the COMPAS suite is also available on the COMPAS website.\footnote{\url{https://compas.science/science.html}}

    This study makes use exclusively of the binary star evolution (BSE) synthesis method.
    The default parameters used by the COMPAS software are listed in table 1 in the COMPAS paper~\cite{Riley2022}.

    Except for supernova mass remnant prescription, initial eccentricity ($e_i$), metallicity ($z$), and pulsar evolution, all other parameters were taken at the default value.
    For a one-to-one correspondence between the two generated data sets, the seed numbers were kept constant.

    For the mass of primary star, we draw the values from Kroupa initial mass function (IMF) with $m_1 \in [5, 150]\,\text{M}_\sun$~\cite{kroupa2001variation}.
    For the secondary star, we randomly draw from uniform distribution to satisfy $q\equiv m_2/m_1$, where $q\,\in\,[0, 1]$~\cite{sana2012binary}.
    An additional constraint of $m_2 \geq 0.1\,m_1$ was placed on $m_2$ as this is the minimum mass necessary for a star to be considered as a main sequence star.

    For the semi-major axis of the binary, we drew the parameter values from a flat-in-the-log distribution with $a_i \in [0.1, 1000]\,$AU, such that $p(a_i) \propto 1/a_i$~\cite{opik1924photographic}.

    For the remnant mass prescription, we first considered the Fryer delayed model~\cite{Fryer2012}.
    However, this resulted in a concentration of NS mass around $\sim1.28\,\text{M}_\odot$.
    To avoid this concentration of NS final mass, we used MÃ¼ller \& Mandel prescription (M\&M)~\cite{Mandel2020}.
    M\&M is a stochastic remnant mass model that offers a smoother mass distribution for NS\@.
    We also switched the \textbf{evolve\_pulsar} flag to \textbf{True} during population synthesis.

    For metallicity, we drew the values from a $\text{Beta}(5, 80)$ distribution.
    The main motivation behind the selection of such biased distribution is the higher metallic content of present-day stars.
    The population III stars were primarily composed of pure hydrogen and their deaths produced heavier metals in the Universe.
    By this extension, the stars that are present now or those that will merge now must have higher metallic content.
    As such, we also speculate that having stars with higher metallic content might produce more NSNS or NS-BH pairs for detection rather than BHBH pairs.
	

    For eccentricity, we make use of two cases,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case I: All the binary systems are generated using a flat distribution, $e \in (0, 1)$.
        \item Case II: All the binary systems are generated with circular orbits, i.e., $e = 0$.
    \end{itemize}

    Details about the selection of metallicity and eccentricity values in COMPAS are provided in appendix~\ref{sec:appA}.
%    In section~\ref{sec:detections} we discuss the summary of the DCOs formed by the COMPAS generated binaries.
%    In addition to the parameter mentioned above, the COMPAS chooses four more parameters stochastically.
%    Including kick random magnitude, kick phi, kick theta, and kick mean anomaly.


    \section{Evolution methodology}
    \label{sec:evolution-methodology}
    We first generated \num{1e7} values for metallicity using the beta distribution within the COMPAS limits.
%    The values were stored in ten separate grid files and used with COMPAS to simulate the binaries.
    We denote the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) parameters of the binaries as,
    \begin{equation}%
        \mone{ZAMS}, \mtwo{ZAMS}, \semaxis{ZAMS}, \ecc{ZAMS}, Z, \o
        \label{eq:zams_parameter_names}
    \end{equation}%
    COMPAS evolves the binaries up to \SI{13.7}{\giga\yr}.
    We represent the resulting double compact object (DCO) parameters as,
    \begin{equation}%
        \mone{DCO}, \mtwo{DCO}, \semaxis{DCO}, \ecc{DCO}, \interval{evolve}, Z, \o,
        \label{eq:dco_parameter_names}
    \end{equation}%
    where $Z$ is the metallicity of the binary system, $\o$ is the seed number, $\interval{evolve}$ is the time required to form DCO from ZAMS. $\semaxis{ZAMS}$, $\semaxis{DCO}$, $\ecc{ZAMS}$, and $\ecc{DCO}$ are the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the binary orbit at ZAMS and DCO formation respectively.
    \begin{figure}[!ht]%
        \centering%
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/binary_evolution}%
        \caption{Schematic diagram showing various time intervals for a binary system from ZAMS formation, to DCO, and merger. The figure is taken from~\cite{Riley2022}.}%
        \label{fig:binaryevolution}%
    \end{figure}%
    Once the DCOs have been formed, we move out of the COMPAS suite.
    For the LISA detection, the DCO formed from the set of binaries were checked for an evolutionary stop, i.e., only those binaries were selected that will merge within the Hubble time.
    The selected candidates were than provided to the python framework LEGWORK~\cite{wagg2021legwork} that evolved them from the DCO stage to the merger state.
    It evolved the binaries using equations from~\cite{Peters1963, Peters1964}.

    The DCO$-$merger evolution method follows the one outlined by~\cite{wagg2021gravitational} closely.
    The evolution was done such that the MW galaxy instance was divided into bins based on the metallicity values of the evolving binaries.
    The evolution time was calculated after taking into consideration the ZAMS-DCO evolution time and the lookback time of the binary produced.
    If a binary, at DCO stage, had a resultant merger time greater than the difference of its lookback time and ZAMS-DCO evolution time, it was marked as an inspiralling binary.
    Each inspiralling binary was than evolved at every point within the corresponding metallicity bin using LEGWORK to a million year before its merger time.
    At this stage, the resulting LISA parameters of interest were,
    \begin{equation}%
        \semaxis{LISA}, \ecc{LISA}, f_{\text{LISA}}
        \label{eq:lisa_parameter_names}
    \end{equation}%
    The SNR was than calculated by further evolving them for the LISA mission duration of four years. The detection is made based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the binary averaged over sky position, polarization, and orientation using the following expression from~\cite{Finn2000},
    \begin{equation}
    \rho^2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int_{f_{n, i}}^{f_{n, f}}\frac{h_{c, n}^2}{f_n^2 S_n(f_n)}\,\text{d}f_n,
    \label{eq:snr_equation}
    \end{equation}
    where $n$ is the GW harmonic, $f_n$ represents the orbital frequency of $n^\text{th}$ harmonic.
    The parameter $S_n(f_n)$ is the LISA sensitivity curve function~\cite{Robson2019}, and $h_{c, n}$ is the characteristic strain of the $n^\text{th}$ GW harmonic~\cite{Barack2004}.
    \begin{equation}
    h_{c,n}^2 = \frac{2^{5/3}}{3\pi^{4/3}}\frac{(G\mathcal{M}_c)^{5/3}}{c^3 D_L^2}\frac{1}{f_\text{orb}^{1/3}}\frac{g(n, e)}{nF(e)}
    \label{eq:characteristic_strain}
    \end{equation}
    
	\section{Evolution and detection}
	\label{sec:evolution-and-detection}
	    
    After running the simulations as outlined in section~\ref{sec:population_synthesis}, we obtained 12254 DCOs ($\sim0.12254\%$).
    Following section~\ref{sec:evolution-methodology}, we obtain the required parameter values of only 6539 DCOs that merged within Hubble time ($\sim$53.3622\%) thus making them a potential LISA source.\footnote{Overall, only $\sim$0.06539\% binary system formed into DCOs that merge within Hubble time.}
    The Hubble time merge rate of DCOs is given in table~\ref{tab:dco_details},

    \begin{table}[!ht]

        \caption{Number of DCOs merged within Hubble time vs total DCOs formed by the COMPAS suite.}
        \label{tab:dco_details}
    \end{table}

    The highest merging rate in this study is of BHBH DCO type ($\sim$74.21\%), followed closely by NSBH ($\sim$72.4\%), BHNS ($\sim$54.2\%) and lastly NSNS DCO type ($\sim$51.55\%) comprising the `candidate binaries'.\footnote{Such DCO pairs which can have a potential LISA detection.}

	\end{figure*}%
    
    These binaries were than checked for their inspiral phase using the $\interval{evolve}$\footnote{Obtained via COMPAS.} and $\interval{lookback}$\footnote{Obtained via galaxy synthesis.}.
    The difference between lookback and evolution time of a binary was required to be greater than its merger time\footnote{Obtained via LEGWORK framework.}.
    As the number of inspiralling binaries in our study was small compared to the total generated population,\footnote{Due to not using any technique that forces DCO production, e.g., STROOPWAFEL~\cite{Broekgaarden2019}} multiple detections of a single binary object are present in the final output.
    Table~\ref{tab:bhbh-details-table} shows selective details about mass of progenitor and their evolutionary ends for maximum and minimum mass at ZAMS and DCO stages. In appendix~\ref{sec:paramter-distribution-across-the-galaxies} we present the number of detection and mean values for selected parameters\footnote{The selected  parameters include, $\mone{DCO}$, $\mtwo{DCO}$, $\semaxis{DCO}$, $\ecc{DCO}$, Z, $\interval{evol}$, $\interval{lookback}$, and SNR.} across the hundred instances of MW galaxies.

    The predicted distribution of the LISA detectable sources is plotted over its expected sensitivity curve~\cite{Robson2019}, in figure~\ref{fig:alldcosnrplotting}.
    The x-axis shows the dominant frequency, the frequency accumulating the largest SNR, for the eccentric binaries.
    Furthermore, on y-axis we plot the amplitude spectral density (ASD), including the contribution from all harmonics.
    The gap between the detected binaries and the LISA curve in the graph is the SNR criteria, ($\text{SNR}\,>\,7$).
    The size of the points varies with metallicity; high metallic sources have larger shapes and vice versa.
    The color scheme is based on the eccentricity of detected binaries, e.g, the red ones are the most eccentric sources, the yellow ones are mid-eccentric, and the green ones are the sources with low eccentricities.

	\subsection{Binary Black Hole pairs (BHBH)}
	\label{subsec:binary-black-hole-pairs-(bhbh)}
	For the BHBH population, 19 DCO pairs have eccentricity greater than 0.9, and a total of 72 pairs having an eccentricity more than 0.75. 

    Around $3\,\text{mHz}$, some binaries mostly have large eccentricities.
    These are on the right side of the graph and extend downwards to $10^{-19}$ ASDs. However, there are also some BHBH that are almost circular and emit at high frequency.
    These sources are in their last stages of merger hence they are spinning fast enough to emit large frequency GW\@.

    The major binary population is concentrated on the left side of the LISA sensitivity curve.
    The peak of concentration around the GW frequency of \textbf{0.12 mHz}.
    The main reason for such a trend can be explained through the eccentricities of the binaries.
    As seen from the figure~\ref{detect}, a large population of our binaries are low eccentric or mid-eccentric.
    There are also binaries having high eccentricities which as mentioned above lie on the right side of the graph.
    The orbit of low eccentric or circular binaries evolves differently than high eccentric binaries.
    After the formation of DCO, most of the low eccentric binaries emit GW in low-frequency bands of LISA as the orbit progresses.
    While DCOs with high eccentricities behave in a completely different way, i.e.\ their orbit decay faster, and they tend to emit GW in the high-frequency LISA detection band.
    Although these are of prime importance in the LISA mission, unfortunately, these are rare.
    Thus, most of the DCOs are at lower frequency regions.

    Fig.~\ref{fig:freq} shows the distribution of the orbital frequency; $f$, and eccentricity at the time of LISA mission; $e$.
    The regions surrounding the individual graphs are the $1\,\sigma$, and $2\,\sigma$ uncertainties which are the variations of the results over 100 random instances of our galaxy.
    We plot this figure using the bootstrapping function~\cite{wagg2021gravitational}.
    The left side of the graph is the orbital frequency distribution.
    It shows peaks of different types of sources i.e. \textbf{0.3mHz, 0.7mHz, 0.99} for BHBH, NSNS, and NSBH\@.
    The reason for such a trend is because of the mass difference as higher mass DCO The distribution is a little negatively skewed.
    As mentioned above, a higher mass DCO at the same distance and eccentricity requires a lower frequency to produce the same signal-to-noise ratio and thus be detected.
    The orbital frequency distributions for BHBHs, BHNSs, and NSNSs (figure, 3a) peak at progressively increasing
    frequencies as mentioned in section 3.1.
    The distributions appear nearly symmetric, but closer inspections show that the left-hand side is more populated, which can be seen most clearly in the curve for the BHBHs.
    This is due to the contribution of highly eccentric binaries, which are most abundant in the BHBH population.
    These systems are still detectable by LISA, despite their low orbital frequency, as the high eccentricity means that the majority of the GW signal is emitted at higher harmonics, where LISA is more sensitive.

    We can also observe the peaks for high chirp mass systems have peaks in the low-frequency detection region, as they emit the waves in lower frequency.
    Hence, this is another way to differentiate sources.
    Hence, the BHBH pairs have the most eccentric pairs having the highest average eccentricity and $\langle M_c\rangle$.

    \subsection{Detections in Components}\label{subsec:detectionetections-in-components}
    Our simulated galaxy comprises three components; Low $\alpha$ disc, High $\alpha$ disc, and Bulge.
    Figure~\ref{fig:pie1} describes the average distribution of detectable sources in these components.
    The average total number of detections are in shown in the middle.
    BHBH, having a significant number of detections, is equally distributed in the low$-\alpha$ disc and high$-\alpha$ disc, while the rest have slightly more detections in the latter than prior.
    Bulge has the least number of detected DCOs.
    Thus, there is a high probability for LISA to detect GW sources in the two components.

        \label{fig:pie1}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Maximum distance}\label{subsec:maximum-distance}
    For each DCO, there is a horizon distance i.e., the maximum distance up to which the DCO may be detectable in
    LISA. This is calculated using the inverse relationship between SNR ($\rho$) and distance~\cite{Lau2020},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:eq1}
        d_\text{max}=\frac{\rho(d\,=\,1\,\text{kpc})}{\rho_\text{min}}
    \end{equation}

    Where $\rho_{\min}$ is the minimum value of SNR below which the source is not detectable.
    We keep the detection threshold at $\rho_{\min}\,=\,7$, and $\rho(d\,=\,1\,\text{kpc})$ is SNR of the source if it was at $1\,\text{kpc}$ distance from the detector.
    We calculated the SNR of all the detected sources at \SI{1}{\kpc} distance using the python package LEGWORK~\cite{wagg2021legwork}.
    Afterward, their maximum distances $(d_{\max})$ were calculated.

    Figure~\ref{fig:dmax} shows the maximum distances for all the detected sources.
    The top shows $d_{\max}$ for BHBH, and NSNS while the bottom has NSBH and BHNS\@.
    These are calculated for all the LISA band frequencies.
    The black line shows the average maximum distance for all the types.
    The LISA sensitivity curve is also overlaid on the graph as a blue line.

    BHBH, being the dominant source can be observed to an average distance of more than \SI{1e5}{\kpc}.
    NSBH and BHNS have almost the same average $d_{\max}$ i.e between \SI{1e3}{\kpc} and \SI{1e4}{\kpc} while NSNS has peak at $\sim\,$\SI{1e3}{\kpc}.
    The red dotted lines illustrate some known galaxies to have a better understanding of distances.
    Hence, BHBH can be discovered as far as Hoag's Object, NSNS in M31, and both BHNS and NSBH are far from M31 but much below Hoag's Object.


    Almost all the highest values of average $d_{\max}$ of four types are around a \textbf{certain frequency} i.e., if a source has \textbf{certain orbital frequency} then it can be detected to its maximum detection distance.
    It can be observed through the LISA overlay that this frequency lies in the area where the detector is most sensitive.
    Hence, if a source emits in the frequency region of the highest sensitivity of LISA, then it will be detected at a maximum distance.

    \section{Results 2: Influence of Eccentricity}\label{sec:ecc}
    In this section, the outcomes of varying eccentricity at ZAMS are discussed.
    For this we use the same grid of parameters used in the fiducial model, however, the eccentricity is taken 0 at ZAMS (E0) instead of variable (VE).

    Firstly, the detection rates and predictions for different sources are discussed.
    Afterward, changes in observable properties are discussed.

    \subsection{Detection rates}\label{subsec:detectionetection-rates}
    The prediction for VE is a total of 136 detections in a 4 years LISA mission.
    A decrease in the detection rate is observed for E0 which is detected in a 4 years LISA mission.
    As there is no difference in any parameter other than eccentricity, then it is surely the root cause of the decline in detections.

    The difference in different types of sources is shown in the pie chart in which there is a clear reduction in the detected sources. \textbf{Explain the pie chart more}

    \subsection{Model variation: To be added somewhere else,}
    \label{subsec:model_variation}
    In a number of previous works, $e_\text{ZAMS}$ was taken as zero~\cite{Vigna2018, Barrett2018, Lau2020,
        Broekgaarden2021, wagg2021gravitational}.
    The main reason for this assumption is that they argue that eccentricity at ZAMS is not likely critical for predicting detection rates as they deal with post-interaction binaries and their orbital eccentricities become zero after mass transfer~\cite{Hurley2002}. %, de2015merger}).
    To test the accuracy of this assumption, we simulate another population with the same parameters.
    The only change is that $e_\text{ZAMS}$ of the binaries is left to be varied by the COMPAS suite.
    We compare the difference in detection rates and properties of the two models and give our conclusion.
