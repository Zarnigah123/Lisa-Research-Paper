    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
    The gravitational waves (GW) were predicted a year after the final formulation of the general theory of relativity (GR) by Albert Einstein~\cite{Einstein1916}.
    Similar to electromagnetic waves, the GWs travel at the speed of light~\citep{Eddington1922, Abott2017}.
    However, unlike electromagnetic waves, the GW stretches and squeezes the space itself thus causing spatial disturbances.
    The detection of Hulse-Taylor binary~\citep{Hulse1975}, and the subsequent observation of a seven years time
    span~\citep{Taylor1982} stirred a great interest in the GW observations.
    It wasn't until 2015 that the first direct observation of GW was made by LIGO and VIRGO collaborations~\citep{
        Abott2017}.
    The lower frequency bound for both the aLIGO and VIRGO detectors is around \SI{10}{\hertz}~\cite{aLIGO2015, aVIRGO2014}

    The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has three spacecrafts that form a triangle, each side 2.5 million
    km long~\cite{Prince2002, Robson2019}.
    Operating in the frequency range of \SI{1e-5}{\hertz}$\,\leq  f \leq\,$\SI{1e-1}{\hertz} LISA will be able to observe the sources millions of years before they merge.
    The early detection capability will help better constrain and determine the orbital parameters of the observed binaries. \textbf{need more details,}

    The system model of the problem in which HZ and CDH are explained in Section~\ref{sec:sm}, while sections~\ref{sec:r} and~\ref{sec:df} describe results, and discussion and future work respectively.


    \section{System Model}
    \label{sec:sm}
    %    To generate the dataset for the detection of double compact objects (DCOs) in the LISA frequency band, we focus on simulating galaxy instances with higher metallicity content in the stars. This was done to try and simulate a closer-to-present-time environment for stellar evolution. For this purpose, the metallicity was chosen to be sampled from Beta distribution.\footnote{Beta(5, 80)}.
    %
    %    [We need a beta distribution picture here]
    %
    %    A total of \num{1e6} metallicity values were generated such that 0.001 $<$ Z $<$ 0.3. For generating the isolated binary systems and their evolution we used the Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics \& Statistics (COMPAS) suite.


    %    \label{subsec:problem-formulation}
    A lot of effort has been put into the detection of potential GW sources for LISA, the resolution of issues that
    might be associated with the background data, and proposals of new candidates as GW sources for LISA~\cite[see,
        for example,][]{Lau2020, Sesana2009, Khakhaleva2020, Renzo2021, Fumagalli2022, wagg2021gravitational,
        Broekgaarden2021, Shao2021, Andrews2020, Belczynski2010, Guo2017, Babak2010, Blaut2010, Babak2008, Ruiter2010, Nelemans2001, Yu2010}.
    The detections of these sources will provide us with a better understanding of not only the evolution phases but also the endpoints of stellar evolution.

    The goals of this research are,
    \begin{itemize}%
        \item to predict the number of DCO binaries that can be detected via LISA in our Milky Way galaxy,
        \item to determine whether extra galactic sources are LISA detectable,
        \item to make a general detection comparison between DCO binaries with and without an initial eccentricity.
    \end{itemize}%

    For this purpose, we generate the binaries using COMPAS, section~\ref{sec:population_synthesis}.
    We also created one hundred random Milky Way (MW) instances to place the generated binaries, section~\ref{subsec:mw}.
    The reason for creating a lot of MW instances was to check whether a binary is detectable at any given distance within the MW galaxy given the same environmental circumstances.
    The detection of the binaries was done using LEGWORK v0.3.0~\cite{wagg2021legwork}.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/TeamLEGWORK/LEGWORK/tree/v0.3.0}}

    This section contains our findings and results, comprising the predictions of the given types of DCOs for LISA in the Milky Way and a detailed analysis of their properties.
    Based on our fiducial model, we expect in total $4.7\times 10^{-3}\%\,(186.41)$ detections on average in a $4\,(10)$ years LISA mission in which $1.39\times 10^{-3}\%\,(108.35)$, $1.4\times 10^{-3}\%\,(6.68)$, $1.91\times 10^{-3}\%\,(34.94)$ are BHBH, NSBH, and NSNS respectively.
    Moreover, we also plot our detectable sources concerning the LISA sensitivity curve (figure~\ref{detect}) in section~\ref{subsec:r11}. \textbf{Tell the summary of the rest of the results here.}

    While this section comprises detailed analysis of our fiducial model, section~\ref{sec:ecc} describes the comparison of
    eccentricity-based simulations.

    \subsection{Population of Detectable sources} \label{subsec:r11}
    The predicted distribution of the LISA detectable sources is plotted over its expected sensitivity curve, containing the galactic double white dwarf population noise~\cite{Robson2019}, in figure~\ref{detect}.
    The x-axis of the graph is the GW frequency.
    For the circular binaries in our data, the GW frequency is $2f_\text{orb}$ is the correspondence for the x-axis.
    We take the dominant frequency, the frequency accumulating the largest SNR, for the eccentric binaries.
    Furthermore, the y-axis stipulates the amplitude spectral density (ASD), including the contribution from all harmonics.

    The gap between the detected binaries and the LISA curve in the graph is the SNR criteria, ($\text{SNR}\,>\,7$). Furthermore, the binaries are shaped based on their type; plus, square, and cross show BHBH, NSBH, and NSNS, respectively.
    The size of the points varies with metallicity; high metallic sources have larger shapes than low metallic ones.
    The color scheme for the binaries is based on the eccentricity strength of the detected binaries, shown through a color bar at the bottom left in the plot.
    For example, the red ones are the most eccentric sources, the yellow ones are mid-eccentric, and the green ones are the sources with low eccentricities.

    Around $3\,\text{mHz}$, some binaries mostly have large eccentricities.
    These are on the right side of the graph and extend downwards to $10^{-19}$ ASDs. However, there are also some BHBH that are almost circular and emit at high frequency.
    These sources are in their last stages of merger hence they are spinning fast enough to emit large frequency GW\@.

    The major binary population is concentrated on the left side of the LISA sensitivity curve.
    The peak of concentration around the GW frequency of \textbf{0.12 mHz}.
    The main reason for such a trend can be explained through the eccentricities of the binaries.
    As seen from the figure~\ref{detect}, a large population of our binaries are low eccentric or mid-eccentric.
    There are also binaries having high eccentricities which as mentioned above lie on the right side of the graph.
    The orbit of low eccentric or circular binaries evolves differently than high eccentric binaries.
    After the formation of DCO, most of the low eccentric binaries emit GW in low-frequency bands of LISA as the orbit progresses.
    While DCOs with high eccentricities behave in a completely different way, i.e.\ their orbit decay faster, and they tend to emit GW in the high-frequency LISA detection band.
    Although these are of prime importance in the LISA mission, unfortunately, these are rare.
    Thus, most of the DCOs are at lower frequency regions.

    Fig.~\ref{fig:freq} shows the distribution of the orbital frequency; $f$, and eccentricity at the time of LISA mission; $e$.
    The regions surrounding the individual graphs are the $1\,\sigma$, and $2\,\sigma$ uncertainties which are the variations of the results over 100 random instances of our galaxy.
    We plot this figure using the bootstrapping function~\cite{wagg2021gravitational}.
    The left side of the graph is the orbital frequency distribution.
    It shows peaks of different types of sources i.e. \textbf{0.3mHz, 0.7mHz, 0.99} for BHBH, NSNS, and NSBH\@.
    The reason for such a trend is because of the mass difference as higher mass DCO The distribution is a little negatively skewed.
    As mentioned above, a higher mass DCO at the same distance and eccentricity requires a lower frequency to produce the same signal-to-noise ratio and thus be detected.
    The orbital frequency distributions for BHBHs, BHNSs, and NSNSs (figure, 3a) peak at progressively increasing
    frequencies as mentioned in section 3.1.
    The distributions appear nearly symmetric, but closer inspections show that the left-hand side is more populated, which can be seen most clearly in the curve for the BHBHs.
    This is due to the contribution of highly eccentric binaries, which are most abundant in the BHBH population.
    These systems are still detectable by LISA, despite their low orbital frequency, as the high eccentricity means that the majority of the GW signal is emitted at higher harmonics, where LISA is more sensitive.

    We can also observe the peaks for high chirp mass systems have peaks in the low-frequency detection region, as they emit the waves in lower frequency.
    Hence, this is another way to differentiate sources.
    Hence, the BHBH pairs have the most eccentric pairs having the highest average eccentricity and $\langle M_c\rangle$.

    \subsection{Detections in Components}\label{subsec:detections-in-components}
    Our simulated galaxy comprises three components; Low $\alpha$ disc, High $\alpha$ disc, and Bulge.
    Figure~\ref{fig:pie1} describes the average distribution of detectable sources in these components.
    The average total number of detections are in shown in the middle.
    BHBH, having a significant number of detections, is equally distributed in the low$-\alpha$ disc and high$-\alpha$ disc, while the rest have slightly more detections in the latter than prior.
    Bulge has the least number of detected DCOs.
    Thus, there is a high probability for LISA to detect GW sources in the two components.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/pie_chart}
        \caption{Average detectable sources distribution in three components of simulated milky way}
        \label{fig:pie1}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Maximum distance}\label{subsec:maximum-distance}
    For each DCO, there is a horizon distance i.e., the maximum distance up to which the DCO may be detectable in
    LISA. This is calculated using the inverse relationship between SNR ($\rho$) and distance~\cite{Lau2020},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:eq1}
        d_\text{max}=\frac{\rho(d\,=\,1\,\text{kpc})}{\rho_\text{min}}
    \end{equation}

    Where $\rho_{\min}$ is the minimum value of SNR below which the source is not detectable.
    We keep the detection threshold at $\rho_{\min}\,=\,7$, and $\rho(d\,=\,1\,\text{kpc})$ is SNR of the source if it was at $1\,\text{kpc}$ distance from the detector.
    We calculated the SNR of all the detected sources at \SI{1}{\kpc} distance using the python package LEGWORK~\cite{wagg2021legwork}.
    Afterward, their maximum distances $(d_{\max})$ were calculated.

    Figure~\ref{fig:dmax} shows the maximum distances for all the detected sources.
    The top shows $d_{\max}$ for BHBH, and NSNS while the bottom has NSBH and BHNS\@.
    These are calculated for all the LISA band frequencies.
    The black line shows the average maximum distance for all the types.
    The LISA sensitivity curve is also overlaid on the graph as a blue line.

    BHBH, being the dominant source can be observed to an average distance of more than \SI{1e5}{\kpc}.
    NSBH and BHNS have almost the same average $d_{\max}$ i.e between \SI{1e3}{\kpc} and \SI{1e4}{\kpc} while NSNS has peak at $\sim\,$\SI{1e3}{\kpc}.
    The red dotted lines illustrate some known galaxies to have a better understanding of distances.
    Hence, BHBH can be discovered as far as Hoag's Object, NSNS in M31, and both BHNS and NSBH are far from M31 but much below Hoag's Object.


    Almost all the highest values of average $d_{\max}$ of four types are around a \textbf{certain frequency} i.e.\ if a source has \textbf{certain orbital frequency} then it can be detected to its maximum detection distance.
    It can be observed through the LISA overlay that this frequency lies in the area where the detector is most sensitive.
    Hence, if a source emits in the frequency region of the highest sensitivity of LISA, then it will be detected at a maximum distance.

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/DMAX}
        \caption{Maximum distances for all of the different types of DCO. The average maximum distance is
        shown through a black line while the blue line shows the overlaid LISA sensitivity curve}
        \label{fig:dmax}
    \end{figure}


    \section{Results 2: Influence of Eccentricity}\label{sec:ecc}
    In this section, the outcomes of varying eccentricity at ZAMS are discussed.
    For this we use the same grid of parameters used in the fiducial model, however, the eccentricity is taken 0 at ZAMS (E0) instead of variable (VE).

    Firstly, the detection rates and predictions for different sources are discussed.
    Afterward, changes in observable properties are discussed.

    \subsection{Detection rates}\label{subsec:detection-rates}
    The prediction for VE is a total of 136 detections in a 4 years LISA mission.
    A decrease in the detection rate is observed for E0 which is detected in a 4 years LISA mission.
    As there is no difference in any parameter other than eccentricity, then it is surely the root cause of the decline in detections.

    The difference in different types of sources is shown in the pie chart in which there is a clear reduction in the detected sources. \textbf{Explain the pie chart more}
